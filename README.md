# Simulation Environment Test
## Keyboard Control Test
Under `gym_dcmm/envs/`, run:

```bash
python3 DcmmVecEnv.py --viewer
```

Keyboard control:

1. `‚Üë` (up) : increase the y linear velocity (base frame) by 1 m/s;
2. `‚Üì` (down) : decrease the y linear velocity (base frame) by 1 m/s;
3. `‚Üê` (left) : increase x linear velocity (base frame) by 1 m/s;
4. `‚Üí` (right) : decrease x linear velocity (base frame) by 1 m/s;
5. `4` (turn left) : decrease counter-clockwise angular velocity by 0.2 rad/s;
6. `6` (turn right) : increase counter-clockwise angular velocity by 0.2 rad/s;
7. `+`: increase the position & roll of the arm end effector by (0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1) m;
8. `-`: decrease the position & roll of the arm end effector by (0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1) m;
9. `7`: increase the joint position of the hand by (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2) rad;
10. `9`: decrease the joint position of the hand by (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2) rad;

**Note**: DO NOT change the speed of the mobile base too dramatically, or it might tip over.

# Simulation Training/Testing

</div>

## Training/Testing Settings
We utilize 64 CPUs and a single Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti GPU for model training. Regarding the efficiency, it is recommended to use at least 12 CPUs to create over 16 parallel environments during training.
1. `configs/config.yaml`: 

    ```yaml
    # Disables viewer or camera visualization
    viewer: False
    imshow_cam: False
    # RL Arguments
    test: False # False, True
    task: Tracking # Catching_TwoStage, Catching_OneStage, Tracking
    num_envs: 32 # This should be no more than 2x your CPUs (1x is recommended)
    object_eval: False
    # used to set checkpoint path
    checkpoint_tracking: ''
    checkpoint_catching: ''
    # checkpoint_tracking: 'assets/models/track.pth'
    # checkpoint_catching: 'assets/models/catch_two_stage.pth'
    ```
    * `num_envs (int)`: the number of paralleled environments;
    * `task (str)`: task type (Tracking or Catching);
    * `test (bool)`: Setting to True enables testing mode, while setting to False enables training mode;
    * `checkpoint_tracking/catching (str)`: Load the pre-trained model for training/testing;
    * `viewer (bool)`: Launch the Mujoco viewer or not;
    * `imshow_cam (bool)`: Visualize the camera scene or not;
    * `object_eval (bool)`: Use the unseen objects or not;
2. `configs/train/DcmmPPO.yaml`:
    * `minibatch_size`: The batch size for network input during PPO training;
    * `horizon_length`: The number of steps collected in a single trajectory during exploration;

    **Note**: In the training mode, must satisfy: `num_envs` * `horizon_length` = n * `minibatch_size`, where n is a positive integer.

## Testing
We provide our tracking model and catching model trained in a two-stage manner, which are `assets/models/track.pth` and `assets/models/catch_two_stage.pth`. You can test them for the tracking and catching task. Also, You can choose to evaluate on the training objects or the unseen objects by setting `object_eval`.

### Testing on the Tracking Task 
Under the root `catch_it`:
```bash
python3 train_DCMM.py test=True task=Tracking num_envs=1 checkpoint_tracking=$(path_to_tracking_model) object_eval=True viewer=$(open_mujoco_viewer_or_not) imshow_cam=$(imshow_camera_or_not)
```
### Testing on the Catching Task
```bash
python3 train_DCMM.py test=True task=Catching_TwoStage num_envs=1 checkpoint_catching=$(path_to_catching_model) object_eval=True viewer=$(open_mujoco_viewer_or_not) imshow_cam=$(imshow_camera_or_not)
```

## Two-Stage Training From Scratch
**Reminder**: 
Please check these three parameters again `num_envs * horizon_length = n * minibatch_size`, where `n` is a positive integer. 
### Stage 1: Tracking Task
Under the root `catch_it`, train the base and arm to **track** the randomly thrown objects:
```bash
python3 train_DCMM.py test=False task=Tracking num_envs=$(number_of_CPUs)
```

### Stage 2: Catching Task
* Firts, load the tracking model from stage 1, and fill its path to the `checkpoint_tracking` in `configs/config.yaml`.

  We provide our tracking model, which is `assets/models/track.pth`, which can be used to train the catching task (stage 2) directly.

* Second, train the whole body (the base, arm and hand) to **catch** the randomly thrown objects:
  ```bash
  python3 train_DCMM.py test=False task=Catching_TwoStage num_envs=$(number_of_CPUs) checkpoint_tracking=$(path_to_tracking_model)
  ``` 

## One-Stage Training From Scratch
In the one-stage training baseline, we don't pre-train a tracking model but directly train a catching model from scratch. Similar to the setting of training tracking model, run:
```bash
python3 train_DCMM.py test=False task=Catching_OneStage num_envs=$(number_of_CPUs)
```
## Logger
You can visualize the training curves and metrics via `wandb`. In `configs/config.yaml`:
```yaml
# wandb config
output_name: Dcmm
wandb_mode: "disabled"  # "online" | "offline" | "disabled"
wandb_entity: 'Your_username'
# wandb_project: 'RL_Dcmm_Track_Random'
wandb_project: 'RL_Dcmm_Catch_Random'
```

## Issues
You can create an issue if you meet any other bugs.

* If some mujoco rendering errors happen `mujoco.FatalError: gladLoadGL error`, try adding the following line before `main()` in the `train_DCMM.py` and `gym_dcmm/envs/DcmmVecEnv.py`:
  ```python
  os.environ['MUJOCO_GL'] = 'egl'
  ```
